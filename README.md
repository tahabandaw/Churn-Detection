### ReadMe for Churn Prediction Model Repository

# Churn Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning model and accompanying code to predict customer churn. The application is implemented using Python and Gradio, and it utilizes a trained Logistic Regression model with preprocessing steps like label encoding, one-hot encoding, and scaling. 

The Gradio interface makes it easy to interact with the model through a user-friendly web-based interface.

## Features

- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Includes label encoding, one-hot encoding, and min-max scaling.
- **Prediction Model**: Logistic Regression model trained on customer churn data.
- **Interactive Interface**: Built with Gradio to allow users to input data and get predictions.

## File Descriptions

1. **`app.ipynb`**: Main application file containing the preprocessing logic, model inference, and Gradio interface.
2. **`label_encoders.pkl`**: Serialized label encoders for categorical data.
3. **`one_hot_encoder.pkl`**: Serialized one-hot encoder for categorical data.
4. **`min_max_scaler.pkl`**: Serialized min-max scaler for numerical data.
5. **`logistic_regression_model.pkl`**: Trained Logistic Regression model.
6. **`label_encoder_target.pkl`**: Label encoder for encoding the target variable.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `joblib`, `gradio`
- The required `.pkl` files (`label_encoders.pkl`, `one_hot_encoder.pkl`, `min_max_scaler.pkl`, `logistic_regression_model.pkl`, `label_encoder_target.pkl`).

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tahabandaw/churn-prediction.git
    cd churn-prediction
    ```
2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy joblib gradio
    ```
3. Ensure all the necessary `.pkl` files are in the same directory as `app.ipynb`.

---

## Usage Instructions

1. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python app.ipynb
    ```
2. Open the link generated by Gradio in your browser.

3. Input the customer data in the provided fields and click **Submit** to see the prediction result (`Churn` or `No Churn`).

## Example Input Fields

- Gender: `Male` or `Female`
- Senior Citizen: `0` or `1`
- Partner: `Yes` or `No`
- Dependents: `Yes` or `No`
- Tenure: Number of months as an integer
- Monthly Charges: Float value
- Total Charges: Float value
- Internet Service: `DSL`, `Fiber optic`, or `No`
- Contract Type: `Month-to-month`, `One year`, or `Two year`
- Payment Method: `Electronic check`, `Mailed check`, etc.

---

## Output
The application predicts whether a customer will **Churn** or **Not Churn**.

---

## Future Improvements
- Add support for batch processing of multiple customers.
- Enhance the model with additional feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.
- Expand the Gradio interface for better user experience.
